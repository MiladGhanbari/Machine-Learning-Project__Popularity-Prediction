# Popularity-Prediction
In this project the popularity prediction of comments was investigated based on linear regression technique. The chosen website for obtaining dataset and verification of developed model was Reddit. To achieve this goal, some useful features were extracted from the dataset. Rather than comment's content which usually determines the comment popularity, there are some other useful factors including number of replies on the comment (named children), whether the comment is in the main root or not (named is root) and how controversial the comment is (named controversiality), most frequent word counting, etc. Furthermore, it was seen that considering the square of children and the product of controversiality and children as features can enhance the performance of estimation. Based on the idea that punctuation and stop words cannot usually determine the popularity of a comment, the inverse number of these words was considered as another feature for the model. By adding the last four mentioned features, the mean squared error (MSE) decreased by 0.025. The model parameters were obtained based on both closed-form and gradient descent approaches. Higher stability and less runtime were seen in the closed-form approach compared to the gradient descent approach (valid when the features are independent). Finally, the developed model was examined on the test data and achieved MSE was 1.2443.
